# What all Microrobots have in common
Of course this highly depends on the specific task and enviroment the microrobot was build to complete.
## Requirements on On-Board Electronics
Generally speaking we are looking for compact layouts with minimal power consumption (=power dissipation =heat generation).
<br>

When searching for similar circuits, 
- **ultra-low-power (ULP)** or just **low-power**   
- **low-cost** = **low-area**  

are the common keywords to find references with minimal power consumption and compact layouts. <br>

Looking into patens and papers for 
- IoT
- biomedical implants
- space electronics

can also be a good idea, because **low power dissipation** ist critical for those applications. Although those circuits probably need some adjustments regarding their area.

# Example Blood Vessels of Mammals
# Example Lab-on-Chip
# Example Soil
# Example Human Skin
# Example Airborne inside buildings
# Example Airborne outside buildings
