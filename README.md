##  Open Source Mobile Microrobotics Framework üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

### Scope of SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
- Providing low-power, low-area silicon proven-, tested-,open source-, reusable **Circuit-Blocks**.
- Providing **Fast Development Tool (FDT)** for estimating forces, materials, actuation, locomotion and powering. 
- Up-to-date classification and visualizing of cutting edge advancements.s
- Providing interoperability between software

### Goal of SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The goal of SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is to accelerate advances in the field of untethered mobile microrobotics. Or in economics terms: **Drive Innovation**. To achieve this goal multiple problems have been identified:

- lack of existing products
- lack of research funding
- lack of talents
- lack of societal attention

SuRF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è will attack those problems simultaniously by 
- lowering engagement barrier for students and hobbyists
- reducing development cost for companies
- reducing product cost for customers
- minimizing failure rate for new companies


If you are well-versed in Microrobotics you can skip to the detailed information in the projects [documentation](docs/documentation.md). <br><br>
If you are new to the field of **Microrobotics‚ù§Ô∏è** that's even better! For you I would recommend reading this current Introduction file or the corresponding [visual introduction to microrobotics](barrier-free-introduction.md), before taking a deep dive into the marvelous world of the microscale.


# What is a Mobile Microrobot?

```
    "A mobile microrobot [...] [is] a mobile robotic system where its untethered 
    mobile component has all dimension less than 1 mm and larger than 1 um 
    and its mechanics is dominated by microscale physical forces and effects."

### What can Microrobots used for?
There are currently five different fields where potential microrobotic applications could give an econimically advantage over existing prodcuts or prodecures. Either making them more secure, cheaper or possible in the first place. Those Fieldsa are Healthcare, Bioengineering, Micromanufacturing, Microfluidics, Mobile Sensor Networks, Mobile Sensor Networks[[1]](#1.2).
- Healthcare: 
    - [Cargo Delivery](https://pi.is.mpg.de/research_projects/cargo-drug-gene-etc) []()[]()[]()
    - [Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_procedure) []()[]()[]()
    - [Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)](https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/mechanisms-of-action/blood-brain-barrier-opening/) opening []()[]()[]()
    - [Biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm) removal []()[]()[]()
    - [Fertilazation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_fertilization) []()[]()[]()
    - [Embolization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization) []()[]()[]()
    - [Thromoblysis](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/find-a-program-or-service/heart-and-vascular/vascular-surgery-and-endovascular-therapy/vascular-procedures/thrombolysis) []()[]()[]() 
- Bioengineering
- Micromanufacturing
- Microfluidics
- Mobile Sensor Networks

Additionally, [Environmental Remediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_remediation) is also a possible application for microrobotics, but because of their relatively simplistic behavior, no need for communication and low-cost requirements, microrobots for Environmental Remediation will likely not include any CMOS Technology but rather manipulate existing Biological organisms or particles to achieve specific movement, reaction and replication.

### State of the Art
Even tho the former definition of mobile microrobots excludes alot of small robots and focusing only on on-board actuated robots excludes even more, there is still a vast variety of robots with completely different application, energy source, actuation method and locomoation method. But not many of those are beyond the concept stage. Thats the reason

Curerntly many research laboratories focus on manipulating micro-particles with external magnetic fields by using machines similar to an MRI-scanner. This has the big advantage to be able to realize real world medical applications in the coming years.
